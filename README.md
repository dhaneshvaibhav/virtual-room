## Testing Across Multiple Systems

To test the group study functionality across multiple systems:

1. **Deploy the server**:
   - Ensure the server is running on a machine accessible to all participants
   - Update the `VITE_SIGNALING_SERVER` in the client's `.env` file to point to the server's IP/hostname

2. **Connect from multiple clients**:
   - Each participant should run the client application
   - Create a study room on one client and share the room code
   - Other participants can join using the room code
